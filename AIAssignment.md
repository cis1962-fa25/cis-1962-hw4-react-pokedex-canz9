Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.

Okay — this error means TypeScript is NOT seeing your jsx setting at all.
So even though you added "jsx": "react-jsx" in one tsconfig, your project is not using that tsconfig.

This happens in Vite projects because Vite uses:

tsconfig.app.json
tsconfig.node.json


AND your root tsconfig.json just points to them.

If you don’t add "jsx": "react-jsx" to the correct config file, TypeScript will still complain.

✅ THE FIX: Add "jsx": "react-jsx" to the correct tsconfig file

### Part 2

> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?
I used AI becasue I was struggling with some errors and bugs and AI helps with addressing specific issues the most effectively.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?
I think it's reponse was good

### Part 4

> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
